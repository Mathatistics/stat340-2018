["getting-started.html", "Getting Started", " Getting Started In this secion, we will dive into R and RStudio and get used to with it to some extent. We will continue learning about R and RStudio as we go on. R is an open source programming language basically used in data analysis. In R there are many packages that are created for specific purposes and they have made R rich and powerful. In this course, apart from default R package (that is installed and already loaded), we will use few other packages which we will install and load as we go through our exercises. We can use following command to install a package. Below, a car package is used as an example: install.packages(&quot;car&quot;) To load the package we use library function as, library(car) Following screenshot help you to install package using RStudio IDE, Figure 1: Installing and Loading Package from RStudio "],
["exercise-1-create-new-project.html", "Exercise 1: Create New Project", " Exercise 1: Create New Project Creating a project allows us to organize the files and related materials during our study. File =&gt; New Project opens a window to create new project. It will be easier to access all the resources, if all the scripts and datasets are within a main folder, i.e. the project folder. The examples in this exercise uses the project folder as the main folder. Although it is not necessary, but throughout the exercises we will use _data folder as a folder containing all the data that we are using in the course. Figure 2: Creating Project in Rstudio "],
["exercise-2-importing-data-in-r.html", "Exercise 2: Importing data in R", " Exercise 2: Importing data in R The usual data sources can be a text file in txt or csv format or spreadsheet(excel) file in xls or xlsx. Data and R-objects can also be imported from rds, rda or rdata. Below, we will discuss these in detail. In addition you can also find some animated images showing how we can import data in RStudio for each of these file formats. Import txt or csv Base R-package has read.table and read.csv for importing a text or comma separated file (csv) files. Download bodydata.txt and to import it in R as, bodydata &lt;- read.table(&quot;_data/bodydata.txt&quot;, header = TRUE) Here the argument header is TRUE if the data has header in its first row. The argument sep takes \\t, , or ; based on if the columns in the text data are tab-separated, comma-separated or separated by semi-colons. If the decimal values in the data are represented by ,, the dec argument takes the value ,. For further help see: ?read.table Figure 3: Import text data Import Microsoft Excel spreadsheet An R-package readxl helps to import excel file. If it is not installed, you should install it as, install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;) Download bodydata.xlsx from canvas and load it to R as, library(readxl) bodydata &lt;- read_excel(&quot;_data/bodydata.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) For further help and arguments on this function load the library as library(readxl) and see: ?read_excel or ?read_xlsx. Figure 4: Import data from Microsoft Excel Load rdata, rda or rds One can save data, models and other R-objects in rdata or rds format. In order to load rdata, we can use load function. Download bodydata.rdata from canvas and load it to R. load(&quot;_data/bodydata.Rdata&quot;) Figure 5: Import data in Rdata format Reading data from clipboard (“pasting” copied data into an R object) You can import data in clipboard in R. For example the data you copied in Excel or Word files. bodydata &lt;- read.table(file = &quot;clipboard&quot;, header = TRUE) In Mac, you need to do, bodydata &lt;- read.table(file = pipe(&quot;pbpaste&quot;), header = TRUE) This allows us to get the data from anywhere just after they are copied. After every import in above examples, we have saved our imported data in bodydata variable. This an R-object that holds any kind of data-structures such as matrix, data.frame, list or fitted models. We can find these R-objects in “Environment” tab in RStudio. "],
["exercise-3-exporting-data-to-a-file.html", "Exercise 3: Exporting data to a file", " Exercise 3: Exporting data to a file To export an r-object to a file, write.table function is used. For example, we can export the bodydata table we just imported as a text file named bodydata-export.txt as, write.table(bodydata, file = &quot;_data/bodydata-export.txt&quot;, row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE) We can also use write.csv function to export the data in csv format. The txt and csv file format only holds data in tabular structures. Sometimes we need to save other R-objects such as fitted models or list for which we can use Rdata format. We can save our bodydata objects in Rdata format as, save(bodydata, file = &quot;_data/bodydata-export.rdata&quot;) This will export bodydata object to a file named bodydata-export.rdata in _data folder in your project directory.

["exercise-4-data-structure-in-r.html", "Exercise 4: Data Structure in R", " Exercise 4: Data Structure in R The dataset we imported in Exercise 2: Importing data in R is a data frame. DataFrame is a structure that R uses to keep the data in that particular format. If you do class(bodydata) for the data we have imported before, we can see data.frame as its class. There are other data structures in R. Some basic structure that R uses are discussed below: Vector A vector is a one-dimensional object where you can store elements of different modes such as “logical” (TRUE or FALSE), “integer”, “numeric”, “character” etc. All elements of a vector must be of same mode. For example, x &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE) y &lt;- c(&quot;TRUE&quot;, &quot;FALSE&quot;, &quot;Not Sure&quot;) z &lt;- c(2, 3, 5, 6, 10) Here, x, y and z are of class logical, character and numeric respectively. Although in vector y we have TRUE and FALSE they are in character format. The function c is used to define a vector. However functions that are used to create sequences also gives us a vector. For example, (a_sequence &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 2)) [1] 0 2 4 6 8 10 (b_sequence &lt;- 1:10) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Here both a_sequence and b_sequence are vector. Give special attention to the way we have created the sequence of numbers. It will be useful in many situations in future exercises. Matrix A matrix is a two dimensional structure with row and column. As this is an extension of vector structure, matrix must have elements of same mode as in a vector. For example: (a_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:25, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 1 6 11 16 21 [2,] 2 7 12 17 22 [3,] 3 8 13 18 23 [4,] 4 9 14 19 24 [5,] 5 10 15 20 25 (b_matrix &lt;- diag(1:5)) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [1,] 1 0 0 0 0 [2,] 0 2 0 0 0 [3,] 0 0 3 0 0 [4,] 0 0 0 4 0 [5,] 0 0 0 0 5 Here, a_matrix is created from a vector of sequence of 1 to 25 in 5 rows and 5 columns. We can also define a diagonal matrix as b_matrix with numbers from 1 to 5 in its diagonal. Array An array is an extension of Matrix structure in three or more dimension. We can define an array as, (an_array &lt;- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 4, 3))) , , 1 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1 3 5 7 [2,] 2 4 6 8 , , 2 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 9 11 13 15 [2,] 10 12 14 16 , , 3 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 17 19 21 23 [2,] 18 20 22 24 List All the above structure we discussed require that the the elements in them to be of same mode such as numeric, character and logical. Sometimes it is necessary to keep objects of different modes in same place. List is a structure that helps in such situation. A list can contain list, matrix, vector, numeric or any other data structure as its elements. For example: a_list &lt;- list( a_matrix = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3), a_vector = 2:7, a_list = list(a = 1, b = 3:6), a_logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA) ) a_list $a_matrix [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 3 5 [2,] 2 4 6 $a_vector [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 $a_list $a_list$a [1] 1 $a_list$b [1] 3 4 5 6 $a_logical [1] TRUE FALSE TRUE NA In above example, a_list contains a matrix, a numeric vector, a list and a logical vector. Data Frame Data Frame is a list kept in tabular structure. Every column of a data frame has a name assigned to it. The bodydata dataset we have imported is an example of data frame. Data frame is the most used data structure to keep data in tabular format. Lets create a data frame: a_dataframe &lt;- data.frame( character = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), numeric = 1:3, logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, NA) ) a_dataframe character numeric logical 1 a 1 TRUE 2 b 2 FALSE 3 c 3 NA Every column of a data.frame is a vector. Different columns of a data frame can contain element of different modes. For example: the first column can be a character vector while the second column can be a numeric vector as in the example above. "],
["exercise-5-exploring-the-data.html", "Exercise 5: Exploring the data", " Exercise 5: Exploring the data Structure of an R-object The first command you need to learn is str function in order to explore any object in R. Lets apply this to our bodydata, str(bodydata) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 407 obs. of 4 variables: $ Weight : num 65.6 80.7 72.6 78.8 74.8 86.4 78.4 62 81.6 76.6 ... $ Height : num 174 194 186 187 182 ... $ Age : num 21 28 23 22 21 26 27 23 21 23 ... $ Circumference: num 71.5 83.2 77.8 80 82.5 82 76.8 68.5 77.5 81.9 ... This output shows us that bodydata is a data.frame with 407 rows and 4 numeric variables - Weight, Height, Age, Circumference. Accessing elements from R-objects Different data structure have different way of accessing elements from them. Extracting elements from vector, matrix and array For vector, matrix and arraywe can use [ for accessing their elements. Lets create a vector, a matrix and an array as follows, a_vector &lt;- c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;) a_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:24, nrow = 3, ncol = 8) an_array &lt;- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4)) Extracting element at position 3 to 5 in a_vector a_vector[3:5] with give three, four, five, the elements at postion index 3, 4, and 5. In R, position index starts from 1. Extracting element in rows 2, 3 and columns 2, 4, 6, 8 from a_matrix This is a two dimensional structure, we give row-index and column-index inside [ operator separated by comma as, a_matrix[c(2, 3), c(2, 4, 6, 8)] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 5 11 17 23 [2,] 6 12 18 24 We can also write this as, a_matrix[2:3, seq(from = 2, to = 8, by = 2)] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 5 11 17 23 [2,] 6 12 18 24 Here seq(from = 2, to = 8, by = 2) create sequence even integer from 2 to 8 which is used as column index for extracting elements from a_matrix. Extracting first element of an_array: Here an_array is an array structure of dimension three. So, we have to use three index vector inside [ operator in order to extract element from it. For instance an_array[1, 1, 1] gives 1 as its first element of the array. In all these structures we can only supply index of one or more dimension. For example, a_matrix[1:2,] where we have only mentioned the row index, will give elements in first and second row from all columns. i.e. a_matrix[1:2, ] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [1,] 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 [2,] 2 5 8 11 14 17 20 23 Extracting elements from data.frame and list Lets create a data.frame and a list as, a_dataframe &lt;- data.frame( fertilizer = c(&quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;High&quot;), yield = c(12.5, 13.1, 15.3, 16.2) ) a_list &lt;- list( facebook = data.frame( name = c(&quot;Gareth&quot;, &quot;Raju&quot;, &quot;Marek&quot;, &quot;Franchisco&quot;), has_profile = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) ), twitter = c(&quot;@gareth&quot;, &quot;@raju&quot;, &quot;@marek&quot;, &quot;franchisco&quot;) ) Extracting third and fourth row of fertilizer from a_dataframe Same as extracting elements as matrix as discussed above we can use row and column index as a_dataframe[3:4, 1]. We have used 1 in place of column index since fertilizer is in first column. We can also use name instead as a_dataframe[3:4, &quot;fertilizer&quot;]. a_dataframe[3:4, &quot;fertilizer&quot;] [1] High High Levels: High Low Extracting first element of a_list We can use [[ for extracting elements from a_list. For example a_list[[1]] will give the first element of the list. Here in our list we have two elements with names facebook and twitter. So, we can also use their names as a_list[[&quot;facebook&quot;]] which is not possible if they do not have any name. a_list[[&quot;facebook&quot;]] name has_profile 1 Gareth TRUE 2 Raju TRUE 3 Marek FALSE 4 Franchisco TRUE We can also use $ operator to extract elements from named list and a data frame. For example, bodydata$Weight extracts Weight variable from bodydata dataset. View Data in RStudio Newer version of RStudio support viewing data in different structures. To view bodydata we have imported in Exercise 2: Importing data in R, we can use View(bodydata). If you have not imported the, you need to follow the exercise and import the data first. We can also click the data in “Environment” tab to view it. Figure 6: View dataset using command and by clicking the data in Environment tab Summary of data We can compute basic descriptive summary statistics using summary function as, summary(bodydata) Weight Height Age Circumference Min. : 42.0 Min. :150 Min. :18.0 Min. : 57.9 1st Qu.: 58.5 1st Qu.:164 1st Qu.:23.0 1st Qu.: 68.0 Median : 68.6 Median :171 Median :27.0 Median : 75.6 Mean : 69.2 Mean :171 Mean :29.9 Mean : 76.9 3rd Qu.: 78.8 3rd Qu.:178 3rd Qu.:35.0 3rd Qu.: 84.3 Max. :108.6 Max. :198 Max. :67.0 Max. :113.2 Dimension of data The number of elements in a data structure like vector and list we can use length function. For example: if we extract Weight variable from bodydata we will get a numeric vector. The length of this vector is, length(bodydata$Weight) A multi-dimensional data structure like matrix, array and data frame has dimension. We can use dim function to find the dimension. dim(bodydata) [1] 407 4 Here, the first and second item refers to the number of rows and number of columns of bodydata. Similarly, we can use nrow(bodydata) and ncol(bodydata)to obtain these number individually. Lets Practice Take a look at the top 5 rows of bodydata Take a look at the top 5 rows of Height and Circumference variables of bodydata Apply summary function on Age variable of bodydata "],
["exercise-6-subsets-of-data-and-logical-operators.html", "Exercise 6: Subsets of data and logical operators", " Exercise 6: Subsets of data and logical operators Logical vector and index vector A lot of times we want to get a subset of data filtering rows or columns of a dataframe. For which we can perform logical test and get TRUE or FALSE as result. This vector of logical can then be used to subset the observations from a dataframe. For example, Lets extract observation from bodydata with Weight greater than 80. You might be wondering why following code does not work, isHeavy &lt;- Weight &gt; 80 Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;Weight&#39; not found But remember that, the variable Weight is a part of bodydata. We have to extract Weight from the bodydata first. In R, with and within function helps you in this respect. In the following code, with function goes inside bodydata and execute the expression Weight &gt; 80. isHeavy &lt;- with(bodydata, Weight &gt; 80) Here the logical vector isHeavy is computed by performing a logical operation on Weight variable within bodydata. The same operation can be done as, isHeavy &lt;- bodydata$Weight &gt; 80 Take a look at this variable, what is it? : head(isHeavy) [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE Yes, it is a vector of TRUE and FALSE with same length as Weight. Here the condition has compared each element of Weight results TRUE if it is greater than 80 and FALSE if it is less than 80. Identify the elements We can identify which observations that are heavy by the which() function HeavyId &lt;- which(isHeavy) This will return a vector of row index for the observations that are heavy, i.e. greater than 80. So how many are heavy? To find the size of a vector we can use length function. length(HeavyId) [1] 94 Here, 94 observations have Weight larger than 80. Exercise Identify who are taller than 180 and save this logical vector as an object called isTall. Answer isTall &lt;- with(bodydata, Height &gt; 180) How many observations have height taller than 180? Answer TallId &lt;- which(isTall) length(TallId) [1] 76 How many observations are both tall and heavy? Here, you can use length function as above to find how many person are taller than 180. Answer isBoth &lt;- isHeavy * isTall How is this computation done? Here isHeavy and isTall contains TRUE and FALSE. The multiplication of logical operator results a logical vector with TRUE only if both the vectors are TRUE else FALSE. Alternatively : isBoth &lt;- which(isHeavy &amp; isTall) The &amp; operator result TRUE if both isHeavy and isTall are TRUE else, FALSE which is same as previous. Subsetting data frame Example 1 Lets create a subset of the data called bodydataTallAndHeavy containing only the observations for tall and heavy persons as defined by isBoth. bodydataTallAndHeavy &lt;- bodydata[isBoth, ] For other logical tests see help file ?Comparison Example 2 Lets create a random subset of 50 observations. For this we first sample 50 row index randomly from all rows in bodydata. The sample function is used for the purpose. In the following code, nrow(bodydata) return the number of rows in bodydata. The sample function takes two argument x which can be a vector or a integer and size which is the size of the sample to be drawn. idx &lt;- sample(x = nrow(bodydata), size = 50) Here, 50 rows are sampled from the total number of rows and the index of the selected rows are saved on vector idx. Using this vector we can select the observations in bodydata to create a new data set called bodydataRandom as, bodydataRandom &lt;- bodydata[idx, ] Here is the first five rows of bodydataRandom dataset. head(bodydataRandom, n = 5) Weight Height Age Circumference 291 50.2 160 19 63.2 143 80.9 190 34 84.5 79 74.5 182 24 76.8 114 88.6 174 38 101.0 18 70.0 172 22 73.6 Exercise Create a subset of dataset bodydata including the observation with Age larger an 55 and Circumference larger than 80.

The hypothesis for testing the significance of LWT on BWT is, \\[ H_0: \\beta_1 = 0 \\text{ vs } H_1: \\beta_1 \\ne 0\\] What is the conclusion? The \\(p\\)-value corresponding to \\(\\beta_1\\) is less than 0.05 but greater than 0.01. So, at 5% test level, LWT is significant while at 1% test level, it is not significant. Find the R-squared. Do you think the model fits the data well? The r-squared (\\(R^2\\)) for the model is 0.03, this shows that only 3% of variation present in birth weight (BWT) is explained by weight of mother (LWD). Here, the model fits the data poorely. Scatter Plot Make a scatter plot of LWT vs BWT The scatter plot of LWT and BWT is, plot(x = birth$LWT, y = birth$BWT) abline(birth1) Make a comment to the plot in light of the output of your analyses. The intercept for the regression line is 2369.67 and the slope is 4.43. The data-points are scattered around the regression line where BWT vary most Since the data-points are scattered much, the model could only explain small variation present in BWT with LWT.

Similary, it is 99% certain that the interval (-0.029, 8.887) covers the true \\(\\beta_1\\). The 99% confidence is larger than 95% confidence. In other words, being more certain about the true value needs larger confidence interval. Moreover, the 95% does not include zero while 99% interval includes zero. This is equivalent with the result that \\(\\beta_1\\) cofficient is significant at a 5% test level, but not significant at a 1% test level. Regression with categories Here we will fit a separate regression for smoking and non-smoking groups. You can identify the observation numbers of the smokers by: smokeYes &lt;- which(birth$SMK == &quot;YES&quot;) Fit the same model as birth1, but separate models for non-smokers and smokers, and call the models birth2 and birth3. (Hint: select observations by the subset argument in the lm-function using the smokeYes variable.) birth2 &lt;- lm(BWT ~ LWT, data = birth, subset = -smokeYes) birth3 &lt;- lm(BWT ~ LWT, data = birth, subset = smokeYes) Interpreate these models Make a scatter plot of LWT vs BWT and add two fitted lines form the model fitted above. plot(x = birth$LWT, y = birth$BWT) abline(birth2, col = &quot;red&quot;) abline(birth3, col = &quot;blue&quot;) Comment on the plot Fitted lines for both non-smokers and smokers seems very similar, but it is difficult to tell whether they are significantly different. We will later se how we can model both mother-groups simultaneously and be able to test this difference.

In other words, LWT does not have any linear relationship with BWT at 95% confidence level for smokers group. Assume a model with both LWT and AGE as predictors for BWT using all observations.

AGE has very high p-value and thus is not significant, i.e. there is not any linear relationship of AGE with BWT. The explained variation is still very low with an \\(R^2=0.038\\). Optional: Look at the presentation file Regression.Rmd from lecture 2 and produce for the birth4-model a similar 3D-plot as on page 15. You may need to install the R-packages: rgl, nlme, mgcv and car first. Use the figure to get an understanding of the effects of LWT and AGE on BWT.

From the summary output of birth4 model, the \\(\\beta\\) coefficient for LWT is 4.179 and AGE is 8.021. This shows that, if weight of mother (LWT) increases by 1 pound, the birth weight (BWT) is estimated to increase by 4.179 grams if AGE is held constant. Similary, if the age of a mother (AGE) increases by 1 year, the birth weight (BWT) is estimated to increase by 8.021 grams, if LWT is held constant. The regression coefficients are therefore equal to the slopes of the gridlines of the surface in the figure. "],

Both cyl and wt appears to be highly significant predictors for mpg. The estimated effects are negative implying that the mileage decreases as both weight and cylinder numbers increase, which is a reasonable result. The \\(R^2\\) is 0.83, hence, about 83% of the variability in mileage is explained by the linear relationship with cyl and wt. The residual plot of fitted values versus residuals gives an indication of a non-linear relationship, which may be a result of non-linear dependencies or missing explanatory variable(s). The normal probability plot is more or less OK. Ex-2: Indicator variable The am variable is an indicator variable for transmission system of the cars, 0=automatic, 1=manual. Run the following model in R: cars2 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ cyl + wt*am, data = mtcars) Write up the assumed model which has been run here. Also write up the estimated models for automatic and manual transmission, respectively. The model is: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_2\\cdot x_3 + \\epsilon\\] where \\(y\\) = mpg, \\(x_1\\) = cyl, \\(x_2\\) = wt, \\(x_3\\) = am and \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). The fitted model from R is: summary(cars2) Call: lm(formula = mpg ~ cyl + wt * am, data = mtcars) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.462 -1.491 -0.788 1.396 5.350 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Ex-3: Comparing models - Partial F-test From the p-values we observe that transmission gives a significant addition to the intercept and to the effect of weight, respectively. These p-values correspond to testing each effect GIVEN that all other variables are included in the model. Sometimes we would rather like to test several effects jointly. For instance, should we add both transmission (am) AND the interaction betwen transmission and weight (wt:am) to the model? This is a joint test of the significance of transmission in the model. To accomplish this we may compare the fits of cars2 (a full model) with cars1 (a reduced model) since the difference between these models are exactly the transmission effects. This is called a partial F-test (Fisher test) were we test whether the SSE has decreased significantly as we go from the reduced model to the full model. The partial F-test may be run in RStudio by: anova(cars1, cars2) Analysis of Variance Table Model 1: mpg ~ cyl + wt Model 2: mpg ~ cyl + wt * am Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 1 29 191 2 27 138 2 52.7 5.13 0.013 * --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 From the output we see that the test statistic is an F-statistic. Is there a significant effect of transmission do you think? A lengthy answer: We are here really testing the hypotheses: \\[H_0: \\beta_3 = \\beta_4 = 0\\] versus the alternative that at least one of them is different from zero. We reject the null-hypothesis at test-level \\(\\alpha\\) if \\[F = \\frac{(SSE_\\text{red.mod}-SSE_\\text{full.mod})/r}{MSE_\\text{full.mod}}\\] is larger than \\(F_{\\alpha, r, n-p}\\), where \\(r\\) is the difference in the degrees of freedom for SSE for the two models (here \\(r=2\\)), and \\(n-p\\) are the degrees of freedom for SSE of the full model (here \\(n-p=27\\)). From the output we have (note RSS = SSE): \\[F = \\frac{(191.17 - 138.51)/2}{138.51/27} = 5.13\\] We reject at level \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) if this observed F is larger than \\(F_{0.05, 2, 27}\\). At this point we could look this up in a Fisher-table, or alternatively compute this quantile of the Fisher distribution by: qf(0.05, 2, 27, lower.tail = FALSE) [1] 3.35 See ?FDist for help-file for the Fisher distribution. We reject the null-hypothesis. Alternatively we reject since the p-value from the output is smaller than 0.05. Perform a residual analysis of the cars2 model. par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(cars2, which = c(1,2)) The linearity has improved, but maybe there is an increasing variance with increasing fitted value (estimated mileage). The normality looks good. Ex-4: Influential measurements Use the influence.measures() function to compute the Cook’s distances and the leverage (hat) values for all observations accoring to the cars2 model. Are there any influential observations according to these measures? summary(influence.measures(cars2)) Potentially influential observations of lm(formula = mpg ~ cyl + wt * am, data = mtcars) : dfb.1_ dfb.cyl dfb.wt dfb.am dfb.wt:m dffit cov.r Lincoln Continental 0.38 0.16 -0.52 -0.28 0.23 -0.59 1.57_* Fiat 128 0.10 -0.31 0.17 0.25 -0.15 0.91 0.36_* Ford Pantera L 0.01 -0.02 0.01 0.01 -0.02 -0.04 1.61_* Maserati Bora -0.03 0.09 -0.05 -0.35 0.49 0.73 1.64_* cook.d hat Lincoln Continental 0.07 0.33 Fiat 128 0.13 0.10 Ford Pantera L 0.00 0.25 Maserati Bora 0.11 0.38 Four observations are flagged by R, but none according to Cook’s distance or leverage (hat). Ex-5: Model selection Fit a third multiple linear regression model with mpg (Miles/Gallon) as response variable and cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt and qsec as predictor variables. Call the model object “cars3”.

Errors of the estimates due to correlation between predictors, and problems finding truly significant variables. We would like to check various sub-models of this model by combining different variables. Install and load the ‘mixlm’ package. The package contains a function called best.subsets() which can help us find a good model.

The model size is given in the first column. Column two is the rank within model size, then comes a column for each variable with a star indicating that a given variable is part of the model. Finally comes the residual sum of squares (RSS or SSE), \\(R^2\\), \\(R^2\\)-adjusted and finally a diagnostic called Mallow’s Cp. Which sub-model would you say is the best fitting model according to the \\(R^2\\)-adjusted? A couple of models are quite similar, but the largest \\(R^2\\)-adjusted is obtained with a model with predictors cyl, hp and wt. This is also a quite simple model with few predictors. We should always strive for simple models and choose the simpler model in cases where the fit appears to be more or less equal for several models. Ex-6: Model validation On canvas you find a file called “CV.R” containing two functions CV() and Kfold(). Download this file and open it in RStudio and press the “source” button up to the right in the script window. This will run the file and create these functions. You can also scource the file as, source(&#39;_functions/CV.R&#39;) A fitted model should ideally be validated on a test set of new and un-touched data. We could predict the new samples using our best choice model and evaluate the prediction performance. If the model predicts well, we probably have a good model! If we don’t have a test set, we may perform Cross-validation. The most common version is the Leave-One-Out Cross-validation where we successively remove one observation from the data and fit the model to the remaining observations. The fitted model is used to predict the left out observation. After fitting a model, the left out observation is put back, and another is left out. In ttoal we then fit \\(n\\) models, and perform \\(n\\) predictions. Use the CV() function to perform a Leave-One-Out CV using the cars2 model fit by: res &lt;- CV(cars2) print(res) $pred [1] 22.0 20.1 26.6 19.4 16.4 19.1 16.6 21.3 21.9 19.0 19.1 15.1 15.9 15.9 [15] 13.1 12.8 11.1 26.5 31.0 28.7 24.5 16.6 16.9 15.9 15.4 29.0 27.6 32.0 [29] 16.0 21.1 12.3 23.7 $msep [1] 6.09 $r.squared.pred [1] 0.828 The CV() returns a list with three elements, the predictions, the Mean Square Error of Prediction and and \\(R^2\\)-predicted. Make a plot of the observed mpg versus the cross-validation predictions. plot(mtcars$mpg, res$pred, xlab = &quot;Observed&quot;, ylab = &quot;Predicted&quot;) Is the best model from the previous exercise, identified by the best.subsets(), a better model in terms of prediction error (MSEP)? The MSEP is defined by: \\[\\text{MSEP} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_{(i)}\\right)^2\\] where \\(\\hat{y}_{(i)}\\) is the prediction of \\(y_i\\) using a model where observation \\(i\\) was left out from the model estimation. A small value implies better prediction. cars4 &lt;- lm(mpg ~ cyl + hp + wt, data = mtcars) CV(cars4) $pred [1] 22.97 22.08 26.26 20.91 16.98 20.41 15.65 23.65 23.38 20.03 20.10 [12] 14.97 16.05 16.07 11.02 10.09 8.74 26.32 28.71 27.35 25.83 17.69 [23] 18.09 14.79 15.57 27.70 26.62 27.72 16.58 21.28 12.89 24.61 $msep [1] 7.19 $r.squared.pred [1] 0.797 No, this model does not predict better than cars2. Leave-One-out CV is known to have large uncertainty, and using a K-fold CV is an alternative. Then the data are divided into K subsets (folds) of approximately equal sizes, and a leave-one-fold-out CV is performed instead. A K=10 is often recommended. Here, since n=32 a K=8 is better, since this gives subsets of equal sizes.
